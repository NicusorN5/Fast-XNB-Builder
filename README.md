# Fast XNB Builder

 ***This repository is archived since MGCB should be actually itself for this task.***

 A .X to .XNB converter made for Monogame!
```
	Fast XNB Builder is a quick tool to convert files to .XNB (format used by Monogame).
	Command line arguments are:
	/ui - shows an interface to select the folder containing the .X and it's textures.
	/? - shows help
	/f - Converts a folder.
	/s - Separately converts a file. (not implemented)
	By default, FXNBB is showing the interface for ease of use.

	Supported model formats are: .x
	Supported image formats are: .dds, .png, .bmp.
	Supported sound formats are: .ogg, .mp3, .wav
```

This was created to be used with versions of 3DRadSpace older than 0.1.0-Aplha - but since 3DRadSpace is not not using Monogame anymore, this tool is not worth maintaning anymore.

Consider using [MGCB itself](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/tools/mgcb.html).
